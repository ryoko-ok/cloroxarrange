				<h2>Vision</h2>
				<p>Clorox believes clean is more than getting rid of dirt and germs. Sure, it's about wiping away what came before, but it's also about celebrating what happens after. Clean is just the beginning.<br>
				Cleaning houses and keep clean environment is everyone wants and everyone need for family’s health.
				CLOROX reach is global, CLOROX brands beloved. They’ve come a long way since 1913 when bleach was CLOROX only product. Today, CLOROX global portfolio is made up of diverse brands sold in more than 100 countries in nearly every region of the world. They have products that help kill germs at home or in healthcare settings, clean the toughest messes, make clothes whiter or brighter, filter water so that it’s healthier and tastes better, offer high-quality natural options for personal care, manage kitchen and outdoor trash and help improve digestive health, among lots of other benefits. It’s through CLOROX brands that they’re able to stay committed to CLOROX mission of making everyday life better, every day.</p><br>

				<h2>Approach to Safety</h2>
				<p>At Clorox, CLOROX safety and that of CLOROX family, CLOROX pets and the environment is a top priority. They start with an evaluation of every product’s safety, efficacy and regulatory compliance before it ever makes it to store shelves.
				CLOROX safety assessments begin with analysis of each of the materials that goes into making the product. This includes consideration of short-term and long-term impact from all types of exposures, including incidental or accidental, and routes of exposure such as skin, eye, ingestion and inhalation.
				Another key component of safety is ensuring consumers understand how to safely use, store, and dispose of a product and its packaging. CLOROX labels include clear directions for use, precautionary statements, first-aid measures, and storage and disposal. Additional safeguards such as child-resistant packaging are incorporated for certain products.
				All products manufactured and distributed in the U.S. are subject to local, state and federal regulations. To comply, they perform safety testing, make labeling changes, and use only approved ingredients or formulations. For example, products classified as antimicrobials, such as disinfectants or sanitizers, are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, requiring every aspect of these products — including formulation, labeling and packaging — to undergo detailed review against predetermined criteria before approval for market.
				CLOROX safety evaluation also includes an assessment of fragrances, dyes, preservatives and other proprietary ingredients in CLOROX formulations. All fragrances they purchase from third-party suppliers must comply with Research Institute for Fragrance Materials Inc. (RIFM) guidelines and recommendations as well as International Fragrance Association (IFRA) standards, which define safe use levels of individual fragrance ingredients.
				CLOROX comprehensive approach to safety has been successful, as they’ve never had a confirmed sensitization in consumer use of CLOROX products.</p><br>

				<h2>Animal Testing</h2>
				<p>Clorox is committed to ending animal testing in CLOROX industry. They are, and will continue to be, relentless in CLOROX efforts to replace such testing.</p><br>

				<h2>Current Approach</h2>
				<p>Clorox does not conduct or ask third parties to conduct on its behalf any animal testing on products or ingredients within the Clorox product portfolio unless that testing is required by law and there is no available alternative. When the law requires such tests, Clorox selects highly qualified contract research facilities that comply with all applicable animal welfare standards. When legal requirements allow alternative methods, including in vitro testing, Clorox will use them. They have brands in CLOROX portfolio, such as Burt’s Bees, that ensure none of their products or ingredients are ever subject to animal testing by suppliers or regulatory authorities.
				Consistent with CLOROX own policy, CLOROX Business Partner Code of Conduct informs CLOROX suppliers and licensees that they also must not conduct or ask third parties to conduct animal testing related to their products or ingredients unless it is required by law.</p>
